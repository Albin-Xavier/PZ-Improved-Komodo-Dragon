## About

My attempt at improving the Komodo Dragon, the largest lizard to walk on our planet today. It includes edited models and textures for the Komodo Dragon. I made the face a little browner in color to better match the body texture, as well as adjusting the shape of the body to try to make it look more realistic. Also available on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/planetzoo/mods/1187).

### Built With

- [Cobra Tools](https://github.com/OpenNaja/cobra-tools) - Editing .ovl & .ms2 files.
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - Models
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Textures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Legally purchased copy of Planet Zoo.

### Installation

First, make sure you have Planet Zoo installed. Once installed, by default your Planet Zoo game directory is located at the following folder: \*C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Planet Zoo\*\
If you have installed the game to a custom directory, the game will be located in \*steamapps\common\Planet Zoo\* within your custom installation directory.

The mod is included as a .ovl file to be used in Planet Zoo. Extract the contents of the .zip file to win64 within the game directory. As an alternative, the .zip is packaged for easy installation using [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/)

## Usage

Once installed, the mod will be immediately visible in your game! Take care, and please do enjoy it!
